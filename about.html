	<h1 class="about">About M. Designs</h1>
	<p class="description">M. Design is a newly founded web design company based in the Greater Westchester area. Originally founded in 2014 as Bees Design, Malik Browne's freelance company quickly expanded to a more proffesional and reliable website design group. <br> <br> With high hopes of establishing M. Design as a limited liability corporation in the state of New York, we are here because we believe that it's important for any small business to create an online identity. <br> <br> In our years of existence, clients have provided us with amazing references, and compliments. We've worked on all different types of websites ranging from small solo projects, to small businesses such as delicatessens and restaurants. If you're interested in hearing from some of our satisfied clients, please contact us.</p>
